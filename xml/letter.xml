      Just writing to thank you for the wonderful train set you sent me for 
      Christmas. I like it very much, and Sarah and I have both enjoyed playing 
      with it over the long holidays.

      It has been a while since you visited us. How have you been? How are the 
      dogs, and has the cat stopped playing with your knitting yet? We were hoping 
      to come by for a short visit on New Year's Eve, but Sarah wasn't feeling 
      well. However, I hope to see you next month when I will be home from school 
      for the holidays.
