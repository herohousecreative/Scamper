	<a name="Student Request"><h2>Student Request</h2></a>
The only way to request a book now is for a student to go to <a href="http://getmybooks.tamu.edu">getmybooks.tamu.edu</a> and request a book.  
If they come into the lab or email you, direct them to a computer and get them to access <a href="http://getmybooks.tamu.edu">getmybooks.tamu.edu</a>.
<p>
	<a name="Receiving a Request"><h2>Receiving a Request</h2>
The student worker logs into <a href="https://scamper.tamu.edu">scamper.tamu.edu</a> and clicks on pending requests.
<br>
*this should be checked daily, when you arrive for work.
<p>
If there is a pending book check to see the format desired.
	<p>A.  If RFBD, go to the RFB&D website, <a href="http://www.rfbd.org">www.rfbd.org</a>, click on book catalog, enter the name of the book you are searching and click search.  You will look at the product number of the CASSETTE TAPE and record it on a piece of paper.
Take that number, go to our supply closet and search for it.  The tapes may be a little out of order, so look carefully.</ul>
		<ul>I.  If you find the tape, retrieve it, put the students name, telephone 
number, and UIN on a sticky note and attach it to the tapes.  Put the tapes on the top shelf in the alternative format room and
 send the student an email.  Their email address is automatic when you click on it on the book 
request page.  Also on the sticky note, write the date and the action taken each time you do 
something.  Proceed to accept the book request.  This will send it to the Priority List. </ul>
		<ul>II.  If you do not find the tape in our storage, go to the RFB&D website and order the tape.  You will need a log in.  Be sure to order the cassette tape.</ul>
		<ul>**Note for I & II: Be sure to input the RFBD number and date &#39received/found&#39 under the books details.  You have to click &#39update book&#39 for the information to be entered.  Then, under the books details, at the bottom of the page, click on the student requesting the book.  From this page click on the title of the book youÂ’re currently entering information for and enter the called dates.  (this will be simplified in near future)</ul>
		<ul>III.  If you do not find the book on tape on the RFB&D website, deny the request and put in the notes that this book is not available in this format.</ul>

	<p>B.  If .txt or .html, search <a href="https://getmybooks.tamu.edu">getmybooks.tamu.edu</a> once again, but check to see if there is a word missing in the title, or if there are too many words in the title.  (i.e. The included or not, a misspelling, etc.)  As of right now, you may want to check with <a href="https://tte.tamu.edu">tte.tamu.edu</a>, <a href="https://scamper.tamu.edu">scamper.tamu.edu</a>, and our books drive just to be positive that we do not have the e-text somewhere.
		<ul>I.  If you do find the book, inform the student by email to let them know precisely where it is located.<br>
			<ol>a.  If the book is currently on scamper and it was just missed, then deny the request saying that it is already in getmybooks.  Then go to the students account and &#39add a request&#39. You can only add one book at a time or it will not function.</ol><br>
			<ol>b.  If the book is not currently on scamper, but is on tte or books drive, then accept the request.  This adds the books information to our books list on scamper and automatically puts it on our priority list.  Upload the book to SCAMPER from the book&#39s details page.  (Click &#39Click here to view book&#39s&#39 contents at the top of the page.  Then proceed to &#39click here to upload files.&#39  You can only do one file at a time.  So, it is helpful to make a zip file and just upload the zip.)  The students will be able to access the book through <a href="https://getmybooks.tamu.edu">getmybooks.tamu.edu</a>.</ol></ul>
		<ul>II.  If you do not find the book in our system anywhere, accept the request.  It will be moved to the priority list.  You must purchase, cut, and scan the book.  Go to that section by clicking <a href="#Purchasing the Book">here</a>.</ul>



	<a name="Priority List"><h2><a href="https://scamper.tamu.edu/priority.php">Priority List</a></a></h2>
Once you have accepted a book request, whether it be RFBD or .txt/.html, it will instantly go to the top of the Priority List on Scamper with a blank box as its number.  The numbers describe more of what kind of book we need to get rather then the time constraint.  They are as follows:
	<ol>1-19 : Books currently <b>in processing</b>.  Books may be ranked in importance and there can be more than one 1,2,3 etc at a time. All other books that need work but are not on immediate priority can remain ranked 19.</ol>
	<ol>20:  Books currently in processing that need to be <b></b></ol>
	<ol>30:  Books that <b>need to be bought</b> from the bookstore (be sure to check for these at the beginning of a shift)</ol>
  	<ol>40:  Books to be <b>recorded</b>.  (We do NOT need to cut nor scan them)</ol>
	<ol>50:  RFBD Books <b>ordered</b> and waiting to receive or <b>received</b> and waiting for the student to pick up. </ol>
	<ol>60:  RFBD <b>checked out</b> by student.</ol>
*You will need to periodically review the notes to each book.  They will describe the exact time frame that we need to get the book done and whether or not there are multiple requests for the same book.
<p>
**Once a book has been completed with all three check marks in it, it will be removed automatically from the Priority List. (i.e. it has already been Scanned, OCRed, and Checked)   It would be a great idea to email the student to tell them the book has been completed and that it is now available for their use.  
<p>
***From their account in getmybooks.tamu.edu, they see when a book is complete.  It is their responsibility to use this resource.  Plus it saves us the time of having to call everyone.  However it would be helpful to e-mail the student whose book you are working on after you upload any chapters.  The students name and e-mail address is linked in the book notes, so this is not time consuming or difficult.
<p>



	<a name="Purchasing the Book"><h2>Purchasing the Book</h2>
To purchase a book, retrieve the department credit card from David, and take it and the &#34Letter from the Bookstore&#34 to the MSC Bookstore, downstairs and look for the book.  Try to find a used book that has clean pages, with no writing so that it will scan easier.  (Note: If the book has ANY highlighting, it will not work no matter the color.)  If that is not available, go ahead and purchase a new book.  When in doubt, go ahead and purchase a new one; it will make it easier on you.  Take your selection of books to the special counter for employee/departmental/athlete purchases.  Hand them the book and the letter.  The letter tells them that we receive a 50% discount and are not charged tax.  They will ring the book up, will charge the credit card the old style way (slide it with carbon copy) and have you provide a signature and a phone number.  Use 845-0390.  Be sure to keep the receipt.
<p>
From there, take the book to MSC Print N Copy and nicely ask the worker there to cut the spine off the book.  There should be no problem and no charge, but if there is, deal with it nicely.
<p>
Bring the book, sans spine, back to the ATS Lab and write the full name of the book on the receipt and take it to Cynthia in the main office.
<p>
It is a good idea to try to make sure to separate the pages of the book so that they will not stick together as a result of the glue still being present from the spine of the book.
<p>




	<a name="Scanning the Book"><h2>Scanning the Book</h2>
To scan the book, first open ABBYY FineReader.
<p>

Go to File: Scan Multiple Images
A window will appear.  
<p>
Measure the pages of the book and apply those dimensions to the outline of the area to be scanned.  Make sure the DUPLEX box IS checked in order to scan both sides of the pages simultaneously.
<p>
Click preview scan.  It will show the image in the window.  If there is black surrounding the image or if words are cut off, you will need to adjust the border around the image.  Just click in the middle of the border (around the image) and align the left edge of the border with the left edge of the page image.  Click preview scan again to see if it was aligned correctly.  The image should look like a normal page with no word cut off.
<p>
Replace the page that had been scanned by the preview scanner back with its other pages, and press okay to begin the scanning.
<br>
** It is crucially that pages are not missing from the scan.  Just watching the scanner creates many errors because the scanner is tricky.  The best way found so far to check for missing pages is:
<ol>1.  Count the number of pages that you scanned which precede page number 1 in the book itself. </ol>
<ol>2.  Make a simple math equation that relates the page number in ABBYY to the hard copy page number.  (i.e.  There are 15 pages scanned before hard copy page number 1.  Therefore, hard copy page number 1 will be page number 16 in ABBYY.  15+1=16)  This way you can scroll to the last page in the book and say 15+hard copy # = ABBYY page #.  If they do not add up, then there are pages missing.</ol>

Missing pages:  Find exactly where the first missing page is.  Delete all the pages after it.  Pick up scanning again at those pages.  This is the least time consuming method.  It is helpful to periodically check the page #s during the scanning.
<p>



	<a name="Shift Log"><h2>Shift Log</h2>
On Scamper, click the Shift Log.
<p>
The topics will all be named by the date they were posted on, you should do the same.
The best thing to do is to read all the threads on the most recent day to see if there is anything urgent that needs to be done. This will also tell you what books have been worked on.  Your best bet is to check the priority list from here to make sure that the books that need to be done are being done.
